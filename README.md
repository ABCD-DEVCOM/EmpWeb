# EmpWeb
Repository for the development for ABCD EmpWeb

This repository contains most but not all files necessary to run EmpWeb, e.g. the Java Jetty server and the scripts.

EmpWeb however additionally needs also added scripts in ABCD Central (this allows the Advanced Loans to be compatible with the built-in Loans system of ABCD) and - since it uses an SQL-database for storing the transactions - an installation of one of the common SQL-databases (MySQL, PostGres, Oracleâ€¦), which needs to be done separately - use the installation instructions for the SQL-solution chosen.

A separate manual on EmpWeb is available.
